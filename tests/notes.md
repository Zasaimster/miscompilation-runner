## Test Case Descriptions and Generation Notes

This document outlines the descriptions of test cases and the methods used to generate them.

**P1:**

- **Type:** True miscompilation
- **Source:** Generated by LLM
- **Methodology to obtain P':** Ask LLM to generate very basic function and manually change the print value to stdout
- **Change in P':** Code is same as P, but the value printed is different (this is a basic check)

**P2:**

- **Type:** True miscompilation
- **Source:** Generated by LLM
- **Methodology to obtain P':** Ask LLM to generate very basic function and manually change the return value
- **Change in P':** Code is same as P, but the value returned is different (this is a basic check)

**P3:**

- **Type:** True miscompilation
- **Source:** [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Transforms/LICM/2003-02-26-LoopExitNotDominated.ll](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/test/Transforms/LICM/2003-02-26-LoopExitNotDominated.ll)
- **Methodology to obtain P':**
  - Asked LLM to make a non-crashing change to the original code.
  - Added a `main` function to make the code runnable.
- **Change in P':** The modified program compiles successfully but exhibits incorrect behavior. Specifically, it stores the value `1` instead of the expected value `0`.

**P4:**

- **Type:** False miscompilation
- **Source:** [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ccbb8882ac75e73e23f31ad60588a2914ebeef04/llvm/test/Transforms/SampleProfile/fnptr.ll#L37](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/ccbb8882ac75e73e23f31ad60588a2914ebeef04/llvm/test/Transforms/SampleProfile/fnptr.ll#L37)
- **Methodology to obtain P':** P' is the same as P. This is a more complicated function from the llvm test suite. This is used to check if we can prevent a false negative since P === P'
- **Change in P':** N/A

**P4:**

- **Type:** False miscompilation (low probability, but has randomness)
- **Source:** [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/49c31201278ae5949694ed78b69ffbbca6a1826a/llvm/test/Transforms/SampleProfile/gcc-simple.ll#L8](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/49c31201278ae5949694ed78b69ffbbca6a1826a/llvm/test/Transforms/SampleProfile/gcc-simple.ll#L8)
- **Methodology to obtain P':** Same as P4 (TODO: change?)
- **Change in P':** N/A

**P5:**

- **Type:** False miscompilation
- **Source:** [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/49c31201278ae5949694ed78b69ffbbca6a1826a/llvm/test/Transforms/OpenMP/values_in_offload_arrays.ll#L20](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/49c31201278ae5949694ed78b69ffbbca6a1826a/llvm/test/Transforms/OpenMP/values_in_offload_arrays.ll#L20)
- **Methodology to obtain P':** Same as P4 (TODO change?)
- **Change in P':** N/A

Template
**PX:**

- **Type:**
- **Source:** []()
- **Methodology to obtain P':**
- **Change in P':**
